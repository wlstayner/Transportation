  <P>In the last 50 years, nearly every state has seen a rise in car commuting, but none have seen a larger increase than North Dakota.</P>
  <P>Between 1970 and 2019, North Dakota went from having 62 percent of workers commute by car to having 91 percent of its workforce commute by car, according to U.S. Census data.</P>
  <aside class="pquote">
        <blockquote>
            <p>In the last 50 years, North Dakota has risen from 48th in car commuting to 16th.</p>
        </blockquote>
  </aside>
  <P>That nearly 30 percent increase in car commuting took the state from a ranking of 48th in the U.S. for car commuting to 16th.</P>
  <P>The greatest gains for car commuting in the last five decades have been in the Great Plains and nearby midwestern states.</P>
  <P>North Dakota, South Dakota (27.46 increase), Nebraska (18.41), Iowa (16.94), Wisconsin (14.14), Montana (13.64), Wyoming (12.65) and Minnesota (12.1) comprise eight of the top ten increases in car commuting.</P>
  <P>Kevin Iverson, a demographer with the North Dakota State Data Center, and Josie Schafer, the director of Nebraska University Omaha’s Center for Public Affairs Research, said this commuting shift can be attributed to a decrease in family farms and growing urban populations.</P>
  <P>According to data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s North Dakota Field Office, North Dakota has seen a 57 percent decrease in the amount of farms since 1970.</P>
  <P>And in that same time, the state’s urban population has grown from 44 percent to close to 67 percent, Iverson said.</P>

  <P>Mining, utilities, manufacturing and information technology are all growing in North Dakota, mostly in urban areas, where Iverson said people more often use cars to commute.</P>
  <p>In the 1970s, roughly 16 percent of North Dakota workers walked to work and 18 percent worked at home. Those numbers have fallen by a combined 27 percent, almost the same as the increase in car commuters.</P>
  <p>“Most individuals residing in rural areas are associated with the state’s agriculture-based economy,” Iverson said. “As the agricultural economy has changed, fewer and fewer individuals reside at their work location, the farm. That explains why a higher percentage commute now than in the past.”</p>
